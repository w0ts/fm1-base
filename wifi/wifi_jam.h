/* MODE JAM's air: FM-1s of a GROUP play together with no access point, no association, no DHCP and no keys. Each unit tunes to
 * its group's channel and sends ordinary IPv4 UDP (wifi_ip.c: Ableton Link, unchanged) in open ad-hoc (IBSS) data frames:
 * ToDS = FromDS = 0, addr1 the destination, addr2 the sender, addr3 the group's BSSID. Nobody hosts, nobody waits: a unit
 * is in the group from the moment it sends.
 *   the name     fm1-jam for GROUP 1, fm1-jam-2 .. fm1-jam-9 (the user, 2026-11-04); the BSSID 02:66:6D:31:6A:GROUP says the
 *                same in six bytes ("fm1j"; the local bit set, not a group address), so no hash is needed: what identifies a
 *                group in a data frame is addr3, in the MAC's filter (DROP_NOT_MYBSS) and again here
 *   the channel  1, 6, 11 repeated with the GROUP: the three that do not overlap, allowed in every region. A busy channel
 *                needs no setting: another GROUP is another channel
 *   the address  169.254.x.y (RFC 3927), x, y 1..254, from the radio address; anyone else heard using it: drawn again
 *   ARP          each frame received says who sent it (the IP header's source, addr2), so a peer's address is known from
 *                its first multicast and no request is ever sent; a who-has from a computer is answered (wifi_ip.c)
 *   the beacon   one a second per unit, 1 Mb/s, about 0.7 ms of air: the name for a computer's scan or a sniffer. Nothing
 *                depends on it: Link's multicast is what makes a peer. The frames are IBSS's but the MAC's IBSS engine
 *                (its timed beacons, the TSF sync) is not used
 * Plain data: no radio here (device/wifi_own.c runs it on the FM-1; tests/wifi/jam_air_test.c runs several in one process). */
